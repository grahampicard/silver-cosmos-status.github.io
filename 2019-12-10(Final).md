Top 5 referrers shared similar bounce rate, pages/ session as well as session duration. 

## A/B testing
Until 12/09, as can be seen from our database, “Support” has a click rate of 13.33% while “Donate” has a click rate of 4.05%, indicating “Support” is more effective.

(Text of button is programmed to display equal likelihood- “Support” and “Donate” show alternatively as refreshing the page. Therefore counts/impressions for the 2 buttons are similar.)

## Refactoring code

## Pass tests

Passed 100% tests. 

## Unit tests (made our own tests to make sure database was working and changes would not mess up database)
