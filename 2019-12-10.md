The key objectives (Must-do’s) for this sprint were making putting the finsihing touches on our web page and making sure the site passed all of the grading code criteria.

Most traffic was directed from “http://medicine.yale.edu/” and “http://law.yale.edu/”, each sharing 32.5%, followed by “http://som.yale.edu/”(23.4%). “http://divinity.yale.edu/” referred 8.1% of all traffic, while “http://search.yale.edu
” contributed only 3.5%.

Top 5 referrers shared similar bounce rate, pages/ session as well as session duration. 

## A/B testing
Until 12/09, as can be seen from our database, “Support” has a click rate of 13.33% while “Donate” has a click rate of 4.05%, indicating “Support” is more effective.

(Text of button is programmed to display equal likelihood- “Support” and “Donate” show alternatively as refreshing the page. Therefore counts/impressions for the 2 buttons are similar.)

## Refactoring code

## Pass tests

## Unit tests (made our own tests to make sure database was working and changes would not mess up database)

### Lessons Learned
